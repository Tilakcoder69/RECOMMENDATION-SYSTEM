As part of my internship at **CodTech IT Solutions**, I developed a **web-based project** titled **“Anime Recommendation System.”** This project combines basic machine learning principles with full-stack web development to create an interactive and user-friendly platform that helps users discover new anime titles based on their genre preferences.

The primary goal of the system was to offer **personalized anime suggestions** in real-time by using a genre-based filtering approach. Users can explore genres such as *Action, Fantasy, Romance, Comedy,* and more through an intuitive web interface and receive tailored recommendations drawn from a curated anime dataset.

### 1. Dataset Preparation and Genre Mapping

The foundation of the recommendation engine was a cleaned dataset stored in CSV format, which contained important information like anime titles, genres, and average ratings. Each anime in the dataset was associated with one or more genres, making it suitable for **content-based filtering**.

To build genre-based recommendations, I mapped each anime entry to a genre list. When a user selects a specific genre (e.g., “Action”), the backend logic scans the dataset and returns a sorted list of top anime associated with that genre. This ensures that recommendations are both **relevant** and **user-specific** without requiring complex model training or external APIs.

### 2. Backend Development Using Python

The backend of the system was developed using **Python**, which handled the data processing and recommendation logic. Upon a genre selection, a Python script loads the dataset, filters the relevant entries based on the selected genre, sorts them by rating, and sends the results back to the frontend.

This logic was kept lightweight to ensure fast performance. Unlike advanced recommendation systems that require collaborative filtering or deep learning, this approach allowed for **quick response times** and **easy debugging**, which was suitable for this project’s scope and user needs.

### 3. Frontend Design Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The **frontend** plays a vital role in enhancing user experience. I used **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to design a responsive, visually appealing, and easy-to-navigate interface.

Key features include:

* **Genre Selection Interface**: Users can choose genres via neatly styled buttons or a dropdown menu. These input elements were styled to stand out and respond visually to user interactions.

* **Anime-Themed Background**: To create an immersive and relevant aesthetic, the website features a soft, anime-inspired background that appeals to the target audience.

* **Dynamic Recommendation Display**: Once a user selects a genre, the list of recommended anime titles appears dynamically on the screen. Each recommendation is shown in a styled card or block, with proper fonts, spacing, and borders for readability.

* **Responsive Design**: The layout was built using CSS media queries to ensure it works seamlessly across mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

### 4. Workflow and Integration

The overall flow of the system is as follows:

1. The user visits the website.
2. They select a genre such as “Romance” or “Isekai.”
3. The selected genre is sent to the backend via JavaScript.
4. The backend filters and processes the dataset using Python.
5. The filtered results are sent back and displayed dynamically on the same page.

### Summary of Key Contributions

* Collected, cleaned, and structured an anime dataset suitable for genre-based filtering.
* Developed the **Python backend** to process genre input and return real-time recommendations.
* Designed a **responsive and interactive frontend** using modern web technologies.
* Connected frontend and backend logic to ensure smooth **full-stack integration**.
* Performed **usability testing** to refine the interface and validate recommendation results.


**Conclusion:**

This project allowed me to apply both web development and data filtering techniques to solve a practical problem. It significantly enhanced my skills in **Python programming**, **UI/UX design**, and **full-stack development**. The Anime Recommendation System serves as a compelling example of how a simple yet well-designed solution can deliver meaningful results and an enjoyable user experience.
